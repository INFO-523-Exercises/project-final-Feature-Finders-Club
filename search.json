By leveraging sentiment analysis techniques, our project intends to uncover patterns in sentiment that may correlate with stock price movements. The insights gained could provide valuable perspectives on how public perception influences Apple’s stock performance, offering potential benefits for investors and analysts.\nDataset\n\n# importing module to download data\nimport yfinance\n\n# Using Ticker module in yfinace to get data of desired stock\napple = yfinance.Ticker(\"AAPL\")\n# usign history function to get stock data of yesterday with 1 hour interval from maket opening to closing\ndata = apple.history(period='1d',interval='1h')\n\nThe data is retrived from \\(Yahoo^\\textregistered!\\ Finance\\) in real-time. This data contain’s the information about a particular stock and how it performed during certain period. This information includes openning,closing and other related features of the stock. The following are the attributes(freatures) of the data retrived:\n\nData Dictionary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn Name\nData Type\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nDatetime\nString\nThis column represents the date and time for each data point, in the format “YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS-TZ.” It provides the timestamp at which the stock price information was recorded. The timezone (TZ) indicates the time zone for the recorded data.\n\n\nOpen\nInteger\nThis column contains the opening price of the stock at the specific timestamp. The opening price is the price at which the stock started trading at the beginning of the given time interval (e.g., each hour).\n\n\nHigh\nInteger\nThe “High” column contains the highest price reached by the stock during the time interval. It represents the peak value of the stock’s price within that hour.\n\n\nLow\nInteger\nIn this column, you find the lowest price reached by the stock during the same time interval. It represents the minimum value of the stock’s price within that hour.\n\n\nClose\nInteger\nThe “Close” column provides the closing price of the stock at the end of the specified time interval. It is the last price recorded before the end of that hour.\n\n\nVolume\nInteger\nThis column represents the trading volume of the stock during the given time interval. Trading volume is the total number of shares or contracts traded during that hour.\n\n\nDividends\nInteger\nThe “Dividends” column typically contains information about any dividend payments made during the specified time interval. In the dataset you provided, it appears that no dividends were recorded (values are zero).\n\n\nStock Splits\nInteger\nThe “Stock Splits” column would typically record any information related to stock splits that occurred during the specified time interval. In the dataset, it also appears that no stock splits were recorded (values are zero).\n\n\n\n\ndata\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen\nHigh\nLow\nClose\nVolume\nDividends\nStock Splits\n\n\nDatetime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2023-11-07 09:30:00-05:00\n179.179993\n180.820007\n179.009995\n180.710007\n16268674\n0.0\n0.0\n\n\n2023-11-07 10:30:00-05:00\n180.695007\n181.595001\n180.529999\n181.455002\n8190077\n0.0\n0.0\n\n\n2023-11-07 11:30:00-05:00\n181.455002\n181.639999\n180.520004\n181.175003\n7493420\n0.0\n0.0\n\n\n2023-11-07 12:30:00-05:00\n181.175003\n182.160004\n180.934998\n182.014999\n6208182\n0.0\n0.0\n\n\n2023-11-07 13:30:00-05:00\n182.018494\n182.440002\n181.929993\n182.340897\n5219872\n0.0\n0.0\n\n\n2023-11-07 14:30:00-05:00\n182.350006\n182.429993\n181.899994\n182.198303\n5513486\n0.0\n0.0\n\n\n2023-11-07 15:30:00-05:00\n182.195007\n182.339996\n181.550003\n181.820007\n8142789\n0.0\n0.0"

These headlines will serve as a variable to assess the impact on stock prices.\nStock Prices: Gathering historical stock price data for a selected set of stocks within a particular sector. These will be the stocks to study for correlations.\nSector Information: Identifying and categorizing stocks into their respective sectors for sector specific analysis.\n\n\n\nVariables to be Created:\n\nCorrelation Coefficients: Calculating the correlation coefficients to quantify the relationships between Apple’s stock price movements and news headlines, and between stocks within the same sector.\nMarket Sentiment Index: Creating a sentiment index based on the tone of the news headlines (positive, negative, or neutral sentiment) to gauge how news sentiment affects Apple’s stock prices."

    "text": "Discussion\nIn this project, we delved into the dynamic intersection of finance and sentiment analysis, with a specific focus on Apple stock. Employing the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer function from the vaderSentiment library in Python, our exploration revolved around gauging the emotional tone surrounding Apple’s stock through the analysis of textual data. The initial phase involved data acquisition, leveraging the yfinance library to retrieve comprehensive stock data via API calls.\nFollowing this, sentiment analysis was conducted using the robust vaderSentiment tool, providing a nuanced understanding of sentiment intensity in the context of textual information. The obtained sentiment scores were then juxtaposed against Apple’s stock prices, resulting in a visual representation that illuminated the intricate relationship between sentiment dynamics and market trends.\nThe comparison plot unearthed compelling insights into the potential correlation between sentiment shifts and stock price movements. Peaks and troughs in sentiment scores aligned with notable fluctuations in the stock chart, suggesting a discernible influence of public sentiment on market dynamics. However, it is crucial to recognize the multifaceted nature of stock markets and the complex interplay of various factors impacting stock prices. While sentiment analysis offers valuable insights, it should be considered as one element within the broader landscape of financial analysis.\nIn conclusion, this project exemplifies the integration of sentiment analysis techniques with financial data to derive meaningful insights into the emotional undercurrents surrounding Apple stock. As we navigate the complexities of stock markets, this approach introduces a nuanced layer to our comprehension, laying the groundwork for continued exploration and refinement of strategies in financial decision-making."

This is just a educational project to show the correlation between market sentiment and the stock price. Other factors such as Dollar Index, , external factors such as trading restrictions on products around the globe and the undergoing wars between different nations. DO NOT take the outcome of this project as financial advice. Please be careful before making any investments.\n- Thank you for joining me on this exploration of sentiments in the world of Apple stocks."
