    "text": "Abstract\nOur aim is to conduct sentiment analysis on Apple Inc. stock by analysing diverse sources, including media coverage, industry reports, social media reviews, and investor opinions from news headlines. By leveraging sentiment analysis techniques, our project intends to uncover patterns in sentiment that may correlate with stock price movements. The insights gained could provide valuable perspectives on how public perception influences Apple’s stock performance, offering potential benefits for investors and analysts.\nDataset\n\n# importing module to download data\nimport yfinance\n\n# Using Ticker module in yfinace to get data of desired stock\napple = yfinance.Ticker(\"AAPL\")\n# usign history function to get stock data of yesterday with 1 hour interval from maket opening to closing\ndata = apple.history(period='1d',interval='1h')\n\nThe data is retrived from \\(Yahoo^\\textregistered!\\ Finance\\) in real-time. This data contain’s the information about a particular stock and how it performed during certain period. This information includes openning,closing and other related features of the stock. The following are the attributes(freatures) of the data retrived:\n\nData Dictionary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn Name\nData Type\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nDatetime\nString\nThis column represents the date and time for each data point, in the format “YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS-TZ.” It provides the timestamp at which the stock price information was recorded. The timezone (TZ) indicates the time zone for the recorded data.\n\n\nOpen\nInteger\nThis column contains the opening price of the stock at the specific timestamp. The opening price is the price at which the stock started trading at the beginning of the given time interval (e.g., each hour).\n\n\nHigh\nInteger\nThe “High” column contains the highest price reached by the stock during the time interval. It represents the peak value of the stock’s price within that hour.\n\n\nLow\nInteger\nIn this column, you find the lowest price reached by the stock during the same time interval. It represents the minimum value of the stock’s price within that hour.\n\n\nClose\nInteger\nThe “Close” column provides the closing price of the stock at the end of the specified time interval. It is the last price recorded before the end of that hour.\n\n\nVolume\nInteger\nThis column represents the trading volume of the stock during the given time interval. Trading volume is the total number of shares or contracts traded during that hour.\n\n\nDividends\nInteger\nThe “Dividends” column typically contains information about any dividend payments made during the specified time interval. In the dataset you provided, it appears that no dividends were recorded (values are zero).\n\n\nStock Splits\nInteger\nThe “Stock Splits” column would typically record any information related to stock splits that occurred during the specified time interval. In the dataset, it also appears that no stock splits were recorded (values are zero).\n\n\n\n\ndata\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen\nHigh\nLow\nClose\nVolume\nDividends\nStock Splits\n\n\nDatetime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2023-11-07 09:30:00-05:00\n179.179993\n180.820007\n179.009995\n180.710007\n16268674\n0.0\n0.0\n\n\n2023-11-07 10:30:00-05:00\n180.695007\n181.595001\n180.529999\n181.455002\n8190077\n0.0\n0.0\n\n\n2023-11-07 11:30:00-05:00\n181.455002\n181.639999\n180.520004\n181.175003\n7493420\n0.0\n0.0\n\n\n2023-11-07 12:30:00-05:00\n181.175003\n182.160004\n180.934998\n182.014999\n6208182\n0.0\n0.0\n\n\n2023-11-07 13:30:00-05:00\n182.018494\n182.440002\n181.929993\n182.340897\n5219872\n0.0\n0.0\n\n\n2023-11-07 14:30:00-05:00\n182.350006\n182.429993\n181.899994\n182.198303\n5513486\n0.0\n0.0\n\n\n2023-11-07 15:30:00-05:00\n182.195007\n182.339996\n181.550003\n181.820007\n8142789\n0.0\n0.0"

By collecting historical data on stock prices and news headlines, we can examine the historical relationship between news sentiment and market movements. This analysis might involve quantifying sentiment in news headlines, identifying patterns, and exploring correlations. Furthermore, predictive models can be developed to forecast potential future stock price changes based on these insights. The goal is to gain a better understanding of how news impacts stock prices and, if possible, use this knowledge to make informed predictions about future market behavior."
