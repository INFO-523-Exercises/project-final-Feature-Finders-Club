## Vadersentiment

[VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)- is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool designed to assess the sentiment of text, especially social media content. It performs several operations to evaluate the sentiment of a piece of text:]{style="font-size:23px;"}

[-Tokenization- breaks input into words.]{style="font-size:23px;"}

[- Sentiment Intensity Scoring- sentiment intensity scores to individual words.]{style="font-size:23px;"}

[- Punctuation Emphasis - effect of punctuation in modifying the intensity of sentiment (e.g., "AMAZING!!!" might have higher intensity than "amazing").]{style="font-size:23px;"}

[- Negation Handling - effect of negation words (like "not" or "don't") on reversing the polarity.]{style="font-size:23px;"}

[- Emoticon and Capitalization Awareness - Recognizes and interprets emoticons (e.g., :) or :D) and the impact of capitalization on sentiment intensity.]{style="font-size:23px;"}

[- Sentiment Score Calculation - Aggregates the individual word scores to generate an overall sentiment score for the entire text. The scores typically include positive, negative, neutral, and a compound score]{style="font-size:23px;"}

## Challenges faced

::: incremental
[- One of the limitation to this project was fetching data from a live data source. We used newsapi.org to fetch real time news but this platform only lets us fetch data for the past 29 days which would stop us from training the model on a wider timescale.]{style="font-size:23px;"}

[- For the past few months, market sentiment has stayed overtly positive which doesn't help us in training the model well to fit in the Bear Market Scenario.]{style="font-size:23px;"}

[- Stock Market Analysis is a wide spectrum and all Investments should be done with caution. This is just a educational project to show the correlation between market sentiment and the stock price. Other factors such as Dollar Index, Overall Investor sentiments, external factors such as trading restrictions on products around the globe and the undergoing wars between different nations. DO NOT take the outcome of this project as financial advice. Please be careful before making any investments.]{style="font-size:23px;"}
